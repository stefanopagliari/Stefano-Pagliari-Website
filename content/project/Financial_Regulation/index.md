A central theme explored in my research concerns understanding the drivers of regulatory reforms in the area of financial services, with a particular emphasis on the reforms triggered by the global financial crisis at the international level, as well as within key jurisdictions such as the US and EU. More specifically, some of the themes explored in my past research included the determinants and challenges of international regulatory cooperation after the financial crisis, EU-US transatlantic financial diplomacy, the regulation of derivatives markets, the political influence of the financial industry, and the attitude of individuals towards financial regulation.
