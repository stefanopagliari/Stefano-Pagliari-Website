My research into the political economy of international financial regulation following the global financial crisis has also led me to develop a research agenda focusing on the financial industry itself and its political power. While the political influence of the financial industry is a well-established theme within the literature, the financial industry does not operate in a vacuum. My work has provided new insights into understanding the interaction between the political power of financial industry and the constellation of actors that mobilise around the design of financial policies.  This work has detailed the extent to which the political advocacy of financial industry groups often benefit from the support of transnational financial coalitions  as well as other groups across the rest of the business community . It also revealed how significant obstacles remain to the political engagement in this area of those voices outside of the business community that tend to mobilize in opposition to the financial industry.  More recently, my work has also expanded beyond the analysis of firms and organisation, demonstrating that the attitudes of individuals towards financial reforms are influenced by the diffusion of financial-asset ownership.
