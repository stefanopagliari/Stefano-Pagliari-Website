abstract: In the wake of the crisis, policymakers in the G20 countries committed to reform the regulation of derivatives markets. What have been the precise goals of the G20 reform agenda? What have been the results of efforts to implement this agenda to date? More generally, what does this episode teach us about the politics of derivatives regulation after the global financial crisis? Despite the global importance of derivatives markets, these questions have not received much attention to date from those interested in the politics of the global economy.  This introductory chapter summarizes the main themes of the book and the answers they provide to the questions above.
