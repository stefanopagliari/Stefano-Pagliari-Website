abstract: "From the vantage point of the key powers in global finance including the United States, the European Union, Japan, and China, this highly accessible book brings together leading scholars to examine current changes in international financial regulation. They assess whether the flurry of ambitious initiatives to improve and strengthen international financial regulation signals an important turning point in the regulation of global finance. The text: Examines the kinds of international reforms have been implemented to date and patterns of international regulatory change. Provides an analysis of change across a number of financial sectors, including the regulation of hedge funds, derivatives, credit rating agencies, accounting, and banks. Offers an explanation of contemporary regulatory developments with reference to inter-state power dynamics, domestic politics, transgovernmental networks, and/or transnational non-state forces. Providing the first systematic analysis of the international regulatory response to the current global financial crisis, this ground-breaking volume is vital reading for students and scholars of international political economy, international relations, global governance, finance and economics."
