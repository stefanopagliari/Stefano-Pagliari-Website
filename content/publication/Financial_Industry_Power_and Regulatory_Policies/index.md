abstract: "This article contributes to the debate on the influence of the financial industry over the design of financial regulatory policies by providing a critical review of the academic contributions that have investigated the involvement of the financial industry in post-crisis regulatory debates. This analysis will discuss the main sources of instrumental and structural power that have been theorised before the crisis in light of the evidence and theoretical contributions emerged since the crisis. This analysis will reveal how the challenges that financial industry groups face in shaping the content of regulatory policies have increased significantly in the aftermath of the financial crisis and identify what factors have shaped the influence of financial industry groups."
